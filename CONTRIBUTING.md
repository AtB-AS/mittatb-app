# Contribution

See full contribution guide on [AtB org repo](https://github.com/AtB-AS/org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
startup instructions on the [README](./README.md#getting-started).

Contributions are [noted as inbound=outbound](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license). Meaning, the code you contribute will inherit the same license as this repository.

## Conventional commits

To better be able to track changes relevant for the user, we do semantic commits. As we do a Pull Request approach, the important part is for the squashed and merged commits when completing a PR uses semantic commits, but it is encouraged for all commits to use it to easier be able to make a proper summary when merging pull requests and to track history.

We use [conventional-changelog](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/#summary) with [angular preset](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines). Read all details on the angular repo, but quick getting started:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

First line is mandatory, but `scope` is optional. `scope` can be anything to group multiple changes in the same section in the changelog.

`subject` is main commit message included in the changelog. This should be written in a way that makes sense for changelogs. Such as "Nearby departures now updates automatically". Sort summary. If more details are needed use `body`.

### Types

#### Included in changelog

- `fix:` Bug fixes and minor changes.
- `feat:` Introducing a new feature which is notable by the end-user in the app.
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` Cases where there are breaking changes as removed features, or required updates. Rare in our end-user application. Marking breaking changes by prefixing section `body` or `footer` with `BREAKING CHANGE:`

#### Not included in changelog

- `build:` Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- `ci:` Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `perf:` A code change that improves performance
- `refactor:` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `style:` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `test:` Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore:` Other changes that don't modify src or test files

**([from Angular preset](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#type))**

### Examples

```
fix(nearby): Nearby departures now shows correct departure time
```

```
feat(overview): Overview now shows arrival time
```

```
chore: Adds eslint configuration
```

```
build: Adds eslint step to Github Actions

Adds eslint Github Actions to catch unnecessary errors on pull requests for contributors not using linting actively in their development flow.
```

## Code Review practise

1. Be nice!
2. Take the time to understand the underlying goal for the pull request.
3. Provide suggestions for improvement. Show solutions rather than problems.
4. Avoid stylistic, overly nit-picky comments.
5. Don't be afraid to check out the changes locally.
6. Ask (open-ended) questions.
7. Optimize for throughput, not for gatekeeping.
