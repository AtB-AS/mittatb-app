# App release process

## Releasing to TestFlight Internal / Play Store Alpha

These are the steps for releasing a new major version to TestFlight / Play Store Alpha. This may be done as soon as the old version is deployed to production.

If you want to release only for a given organization, the release tag must include the orgId specifier for the organization. The uploading jobs for other organizations will then exit and fail. An example tag for an NFK-only release is the tag `v1.20-rc3-nfk`. Please note that the releases after an org specific release may miss some information from the auto generated changelogs that may have to be manually added.

Skip the first two steps of creating release-branch and bumping version number on master if the release is a new release candidate on an existing major version.

### Create release branch
Branch out from master to a new branch with prefix `release/`, like `release/1.30`.

### On master: Bump version number

Now that a release branch is created, the version-number on master should be increased. So if `release/1.30` is created, then master should be incremented to `1.31` as version number.

Version number can be updated by running the following command:

```bash
./scripts/update-app-version.sh x.xx`
```

Then push your changes with commit message "chore: Bump to version x.xx".

### Register new version at Entur registry

After bumping the version number the new version should be registered at Entur for mobile token to work.

> [!NOTE]
> Please make sure that you have [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed. You can run `brew install jq` (or [similar instructions](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) on other environments) to install it.

Finally, run this command:

```bash
./scripts/register-local-app-version.sh
```

### Create release candidate with the command line

This will create a draft release in GitHub.

- `git fetch` to locally pull all existing tags
- Make sure you've checked out the release branch from which you want to make the release.
- Make sure you're authenticated with the GitHub CLI (`gh auth status`).
- `yarn release-draft` to create a tag for the new release.
- You are asked to specify version. This should be the major-version with a release candidate version suffix, for example `v1.16-rc2`.
- If this is the first release for the current major version use `rc1` as suffix like this: `v1.16-rc1`.
- If a release candidate already exists, increment the suffix number. If `v1.16-rc2` exists, the next version should be `v1.16-rc3`.

### Release in GitHub

Follow these steps in GitHub:

- Go to this repository in GitHub and select _Releases_.
- Find the previously created draft release with the correct release candidate version and click _Edit_.
- Set the target branch to the release branch the release draft was created from.
- Click _Publish release_.

This makes GitHub Actions build the release and send it to TestFlight / Play Store Alpha. This is configured with [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/). The build itself will take approximately an hour, and there may be additional review time at Apple / Google. The exception is if the release is an update to an existing major version, then TestFlight will automatically accept the release without a new review.

## Release to external testers

### iOS

- Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/, login and select AtB as the app
- Select TestFlight in top menu
- Select Alpha under External Testing in left menu
- Add build
- [Select the build to test](#finding-build-number)

### Android

- Go to https://play.google.com/apps/publish, login and select AtB as the app
- Select Closed testing in left menu
- Select Manage track, and then Create new release on Alpha channel
- Select Add from library
- [Select the build to test](#finding-build-number)
- Save and rollout. Will be reviewed.

## Release to production

### iOS

- Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/, login and select AtB as the app
- Select App Store in top menu
- Select plus icon by iOS App in left hand menu
- Set new version number
- On prepare for submission page set the promotional text (copied from last release) and what's new (short summary of what's new in the relase).
- Select build -> Add build
- [Select the build to test](#finding-build-number)
- Possible to choose delayed rollout over 7 days
- Add for review -> Confirm
- Will be automatically rolled out after review

### Android

- Go to https://play.google.com/apps/publish, login and select AtB as the app
- Select Production in left menu
- Select Create new release
- Select Add form library
- [Select the build to test](#finding-build-number)
- Add release notes, same as what's new on iOS. Should also be in English
- Save -> Review release
- Possible with delayed rollout, manually handled
- Start rollout to production -> Rollout
- Will be automatically rolled out after review

## Merge release branch into master

After releasing to production, and the new version is available in stores, the release branch should be merged into master.

1. Create a PR that merges the release branch `release/x` into `master`.
2. Verify that there haven't been any conflicting changes on master.
3. Merge using "Create a merge commit", instead of "Squash and merge", to keep the history retained.

## Finding build number

Go and find the build you want to deploy in GitHub Actions. Either 'Build store iOS' or 'Build store Android'. Check the step 'Decrypt env files' where you should find the 'BUILD_ID'. This may be matched with the build id presented in App Store / Play Store.
