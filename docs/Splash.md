# App splash screen

Splash screen has been generated by using https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash

The logo (`splash_logo.png`) used here resides in the root [`assets`](../assets)-folder. To re-generate a new splash, we can use `yarn react-native generate-bootsplash`. This will overwrite existing `bootsplash_logo@*.png` files under `assets`, as well as edit the native splash-related files under the `ios` and `android` folders.

**Important**: If we decide to handle deep linking, this library will affect that on Android, since it hijacks the original Activity which is launched (and reacts to potential deep links). If so, we'll have to add deep link instructions in the [bootsplash activity under `AndroidManifest.xml`](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-bootsplash#handle-deep-linking-on-android)

*Example*

`$> yarn react-native generate-bootsplash assets/splash_logo.png --assets-path assets --background-color "#37424A" --logo-width 150
